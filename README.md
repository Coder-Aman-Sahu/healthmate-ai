![Use Case Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8759d221-fcd7-49ea-bef8-a9c8cef34dc9)

**HealthMate-AI** is an AI-integrated hospital management system designed to support patients, doctors, and administrators through role-specific features. It focuses on streamlining medical workflows, automating document analysis, and assisting in decision-making using AI models.

This project is developed by a team of three, each responsible for a distinct vertical: AI/ML integration, frontend development, and backend systems.

---

## System Overview

The system is built around four core actors:

- **Patient**: Accesses healthcare services such as booking appointments and viewing reports.
- **Doctor**: Manages patient data, generates prescriptions, and uses AI-powered insights.
- **Admin**: Oversees user roles, system configuration, and analytics.
- **AI System**: Automatically processes uploaded documents and provides clinical analysis.

Each actor interacts with the system through dedicated workflows, some of which are shared across roles (like notifications and search).
